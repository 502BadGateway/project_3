☑  provide a brief description for each treasure and assign each treasure with a score. 

☑ With a starting point, time and a wish list of treasures to find, also provided by the user.

☑  A robot should start with the nearest treasure and gather as many treasures that are required on the list as possible within the given time. 

☑ When the robot stops at any of the treasures on the wish list, the information about the treasure should be displayed on the screen. 

☑ Furthermore, each time the robot falls into a hidden trap during the treasure hunt, the robot will lose the last treasure it has collected.

☑ The treasures that have been collected should firstly be displayed in an unsorted order.

☑  The robot will then show how the treasures (according to their scores in an ascending or descending order defined by the user) are sorted in an animation, based on a user- defined sorting algorithm (e.g. bubble sort). 

☑ Any other innovative features may also be included.
